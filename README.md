# 🏭 STL-Based Machining Manhour Prediction  
### Industrial-Constrained AI Experiment

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores whether **3D geometry alone** can be used to predict machining manhours in real industrial environments.

Unlike many academic or open research environments, this project was conducted under **strict industrial IT security constraints**, where:

- Most open-source libraries were not allowed  
- 3D CAD APIs (CATIA, SolidWorks, etc.) could not be used due to licensing or security restrictions  
- STEP, CatPart, and other structured CAD formats could not be exported  
- Only **STL files** were available for geometric analysis  

Under these limitations, I attempted to build a manhour prediction model using only geometric information extracted from STL mesh data.

## 🚫 Real-World Industrial Constraints

In many real manufacturing environments:

1. Open-source ML/geometry libraries are restricted  
2. CAD APIs may require additional licenses  
3. Direct access to feature-based CAD data (holes, pockets, fillets) is often unavailable  
4. Only neutral mesh formats (e.g., STL) are accessible  

This project intentionally works within those constraints.

## ⚙️ Technical Approach

Since only STL was available, the following geometric features were extracted using `numpy-stl`:

- Volume  
- Bounding box dimensions (X, Y, Z)  
- Surface area  
- Triangle count  
- Mean triangle area  
- Standard deviation of triangle area  
- Min/Max triangle area  
- Aspect ratio  
- Compactness  

These features were then used to train a regression model to predict machining manhours.

---

## 🧠 Feature Extraction Concept

From each STL mesh:

- Reshape triangle vertices  
- Compute bounding box from min/max coordinates  
- Compute triangle areas via cross product  
- Derive geometric complexity indicators  

The goal was to approximate machining difficulty from:

- Material removal volume  
- Toolpath complexity  
- Surface machining demand  
- Geometric irregularity  

---

## 📊 Result

The model was successfully trained.

However:

> ❌ Prediction accuracy was too low to be practically reliable.

Increasing geometric features improved representation slightly,  
but performance plateaued quickly.

---

## 🔍 Key Insight

This experiment led to an important realization:

> 🔥 3D geometry alone is insufficient to predict machining manhours.

Machining effort depends heavily on:

- Material type  
- Machining process type  
- Tolerance requirements  
- Surface finish requirements  
- Heat treatment  
- Setup count  
- Machine capability  
- Toolpath strategy  

None of these factors exist in STL geometry.

## 📚 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Pure geometric ML is not enough in manufacturing

Even advanced geometric descriptors cannot capture:

- Process planning complexity  
- Setup strategy  
- Manufacturing constraints  

---

### 2️⃣ Manufacturing AI must integrate metadata

To build a reliable model, the following must be included:

- Material  
- Process category  
- Heat treatment  
- Surface treatment  
- Tolerance class  
- Machine type  

Geometry + Metadata → Practical AI

---

### 3️⃣ Failure is Direction

This attempt did not achieve reliable prediction accuracy.

But it clarified the real architecture required for industrial AI systems.

> Manufacturing intelligence cannot ignore process semantics.

---

## 🚀 Future Direction

Planned improvements:

- Add material information as categorical feature  
- Separate models per machining process  
- Include heat treatment flag  
- Integrate tolerance class  
- Possibly move from pure regression to staged classification + regression  

---

## 💡 Why This Repository Matters

Most AI tutorials assume:

- Unlimited open-source access  
- Free CAD APIs  
- Clean feature-based CAD data  

Real industry is different.

This repository documents:

- What can be done under strict enterprise constraints  
- Where geometry-only modeling fails  
- Why manufacturing AI must reflect real process variables

* Unable to provide example STL file due to security
* For reliability of model performance, I recommend applying more than 500 STL data.

## 🎯 Final Conclusion

This project started with one question:
> Can we predict machining manhours from 3D geometry alone?

The answer:
> Not reliably.

But this “failure” revealed the real direction required for practical manufacturing AI.
And that is the most valuable outcome of this work.
